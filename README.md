## Project 1: Time Series Forecasting With Long Short-term Memory Multi Period Using Transfer Learning

This is a project I completed for my bachelor's degree, where I built LSTM model to predict the stock price of Ultrajaya Milk Industry & Trading Co PT (ULTJ) using transfer learning. In this project, I did two approaches: predicting ULTJ stock with and without transfer learning. Both approaches were used to compare the prediction results of the multi-period LSTM model for the stock price of ULTJ with and without transfer learning.
