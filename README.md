Hi! I'm Grace, a recent graduate majoring in Mathematics with an interest at data analytics and machine learning. I have developed skills in programming languages such as Python. During my studies I learnt how to clean, process, train, and visualize data with Python to anlyze and idenify trends/patterns. Furthermore, I joined Bangkit, a Google-led academy designed to produce high-caliber tech talents, to gained knowledge about machine learning such as Neural Network, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). More Recently, I independently learned Excel to clean, manage, and manipulate data.

## Project 1: Time Series Forecasting With Long Short-term Memory Multi Period Using Transfer Learning

This is a project I completed for my bachelor's degree, where I built LSTM model to predict the stock price of Ultrajaya Milk Industry & Trading Co PT (ULTJ) using transfer learning. In this project, I did two approaches: predicting ULTJ stock with and without transfer learning. Both approaches were used to compare the prediction results of the multi-period LSTM model for the stock price of ULTJ with and without transfer learning.

#### Dataset & Tools

All stock data in this project are gathered from [yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com). The data used include a 5-year period of adjusted close stock price from 14 March 2019 to 14 March 2024. All process from data cleaning, processing, training, to visualization are done by using Python.

### First Approach: Predicting ULTJ stock data without transfer Learning
#### Data Cleaning and Processing 

In the initial proces, I performed the following tasks:
1. Remove N/A values
2. Formating data
3. Convert the data into supervised data

#### Training
